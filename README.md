# sql-challenge
Create ERB to understand connections between each data.
Create new database.
Clear out all pervious tables.
Make code for each table with columns respective datatypes, character lengths, and keys(primary/foreigh)
After making all the tables I manually inserted the data by right clicking the table and importing.
Then I answered all the queries.

I had problems for 2-3 hours because of a bad pgadmin version. Which made me crash every time I ran questions 1 and 4.
